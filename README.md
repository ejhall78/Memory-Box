# Memory Box

üìñ Many people would like to journal and document their lives, but often find they may not know what they want to write about, or struggle to keep variety in their daily entries. Remembering to take a physical journal everywhere and finding the time or inspiration (or a pen!) can be difficult.

‚ùì Memory box is a journal app created by Madeleine Hughes, Cameron B. Edward Hall and Christina Webb-Sfougaras that prompts the user with a different question each day, wrapped in a calming aesthetic. Guided prompts help reflect on the small, easily-overlooked parts of daily life, encouraging mindfulness, being more present, and promoting mental wellbeing.
